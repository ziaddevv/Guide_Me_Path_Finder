- Add, update, or delete cities and distances
- Traverse the graph using **BFS** or **DFS**
- Find the shortest path with **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- Save/load graph data with file I/O
- Simple **Qt-based user interface**

## 📌 Notes
- Uses Qt for the graphical interface
- Saves data automatically and reloads it on startup
- Designed for continuous use until manual exit
